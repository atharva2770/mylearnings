	<h2>FAQ's</h2>
	<ul>
<li><strong>Why do you do laundry on kg basis?</strong></li>

How many cloths makes a kg?Although number of clothes in a Kg may vary depending upon the weight of the cloth but, usually if we are talking of daily wear cloths (excluding Jeans) generally 3-4 Gents cloths / 5-6 ladies cloths make a Kg.We believe in keeping things simple, our machines are calibrated on Kg basis and we derive our costing on Kg. basis, therefore to keep complex equations out of the way we charge for our services on Kg. basis. We also know that charging piece-wise could give us more margins but, Washdial as a company believes in keeping our charges fair and that's why laundry services are charged on Kg. basis.​

<li><strong>What is drycleaning?</strong></li>

Dry-cleaning is a "wet" process wherein we use detergents as well. The only difference is that instead of water hydro-carbons are used (generally called as petrol wash).​

<li><strong>What is the minimum order size?</strong></li>

Minimum order size is the minimum value of the order in Rupees which is required by us. The value depends upon the location and is subject to change without any prior notice. To keep communication, clear we send a system generated SMS to the user upon successful placing of order so that there is no confusion later. We also know that you may want to try our services first before trusting us with your valuable cloths therefore, *first order has lesser minimum order size*.

<li><strong>How do you calculate curtain rates?</strong></li>

 We charge curtains on per panel basis. 1 panel is 3 ft in width and maximum of 10ft in length.

<li><strong>What if any of my cloth gets damaged / lost in the process?</strong></li>

Well!!! this generally does not happen, but to give confidence to our customers we assure them that in case of any such incident, we will reimburse up to a maximum of 5 times the processing cost of the garment to the customer only in Washdial Prepaid account.
