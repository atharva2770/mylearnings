			<h1>We are Future</h1>
			<p>Safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals are two fundamental issues of importance in drug therapy. The safety of a drug is determined by its pharmacological and toxicological profile as well as the adverse effects caused by the impurities in bulk and dosage forms. The impurities in drugs often possess unwanted pharmacological or toxicological effects by which any benefit from their administration may be outweighed (Nageswara at el., 2003). Therefore, it is quite obvious that the products intended for human consumption must be characterized as completely as possible. The quality and safety of a drug is generally assured by monitoring and controlling the impurities effectively. Thus, the analytical activities concerning quantification of active ingredients and impurities in drugs are among the most important issues in modern pharmaceutical analysis (Nageswara at el., 2003).</p>
